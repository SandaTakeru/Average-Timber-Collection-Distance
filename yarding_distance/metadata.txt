about=This plugin calculates the “Yarding Distance,” which represents the average distance from a polygon to a point. Input : Polygon (layer), Point (click on the map) and Dot spacing Steps : Create dots over the polygon. Measure the lengths from the dots to the point. Calculate the average of these lengths. Output : Calculated layers (yard point, wood dots, transport lines, and labeled polygon) The distance calculation is based on the project coordinate system, and both the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance are provided in the output.
